# ðŸ“˜ Makefile Tutorial

This is a hands-on tutorial on how to write Makefiles from scratch â€” the way they are structured and used in real-world C++ and C projects.

Before diving into Makefiles, it's essential to understand **how to manually compile and link** your code using the `g++` (or `gcc`) compiler.

### ðŸ‘‰ Start Here:
To build a solid foundation, please begin with:

ðŸ“„ [`compiler_linker_flags.md`](./compiler_linker_flags.md) 
*A complete guide to C++ compilation stages, compiler/linker flags, and how to manually build executables, static libraries, and shared libraries.*

This will help you truly appreciate and understand what a Makefile automates under the hood.
